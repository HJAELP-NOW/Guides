# HJAELP Docs :wave:

Welcome to the getting started guides for [HJAELP](https://hjaelp.io/) and [HJAELPCOIN](https://hjaelpcoin.com/). 

HJAELP is a new platform that allows service providers to showcase, manage, and sell their services. 

HJAELPCOIN is the utility token used inside HJAELP to buy and sell services, reward users, govern the network, and more. These docs are here to help you learn about the HJAELP ecosystem. 

We hope you'll get involved, whether as an app user (client), service provider (HJAELPer), dispute resolver (Juror), talent vetter (Validator), token holder, or just an active community member.

If you have any questions as you go along, please don't hesitate to ask in [our Telegram group.](https://t.me/hjaelpcoin)
