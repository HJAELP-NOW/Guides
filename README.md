## What is HJAELP?
Welcome to the getting started guides for [HJAELP](https://hjaelp.io/) and [HJAELPCOIN](https://hjaelpcoin.com/). 

HJAELP is a worker-owned platform that allows service providers to easily show, manage, and sell their skills.

!!! 
HJAELP means "help" in Danish. It's pronounced "yelp".
!!!

## What is HJAELPCOIN?

HJAELPCOIN is the utility token inside HJAELP used to buy and sell services, win rewards, govern the network, and more.

## Why is HJAELP different?

HJAELP is the first services marketplace that gives service providers a true share in the upside and control of the platform they work in. 

When a service provider successfully completes a project on HJAELP, they are paid in cash and rewarded additionally in HJAELPCOIN. They can then use their HJAELPCOIN to create and vote on proposals for how the HJAELP platform should work. 

HJAELPCOIN allows HJAELPers to collectively control the network and take part in its upside. Unlike web2 talent marketplaces like Upwork, Fiverr, Thumbtack and others, HJAELP gives service providers a real stake in the platform at the same time as they earn a living from it.
