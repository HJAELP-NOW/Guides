Below you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to join the NAETION ($NTN) presale and buy your first NAETION tokens. Let's get started!

## 1. Download Metamask (or another Ethereum wallet)

Since NAETION ($NTN) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, you will need an Ethereum wallet in order to buy it. Metamask is our favorite, but any ETH wallet will do.

[Click here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask) and follow the instructions to install Metamask.

[!ref Install Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask)

Now you have an Ethereum wallet with Metamask!

## 2. Buy ETH 

To buy NAETION ($NTN), you first need to buy ether (ETH). You can do that easily, right from our website.

Once you have Metamask installed, [go to the NAETION ($NTN) presale page](https://www.docs.naetion.xyz/) and **click the button that says "Don't Have ETH?"**

Follow the prompts inside the popup to buy ETH and send it to your wallet.

You can find your wallet address by opening up the Metamask chrome extension and clicking it to copy.

## 3. Buy NAETION ($NTN)

Now you can finally buy NAETION ($NTN)! 

Go back to [the NAETION ($NTN) presale page](https://www.docs.naetion.xyz/), adjust the amount of NAETION ($NTN) you want to buy, and **click "Buy Now"**.

Approve the prompts that Metamask gives you. 

Be prepared, "gas fees" charged by Ethereum (basically just transaction fees used to secure the network) may be above $100 if the network is very busy. Typically gas costs between $30-50.
