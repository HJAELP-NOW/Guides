# HJAELPCOIN Presale

!!!


Below you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to join the HJAELPCOIN presale and buy your first HJAELPCOINs. Let's get started!

## 1. Download Metamask (or another Ethereum wallet)

Since HJAELPCOIN is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, you will need an Ethereum wallet in order to buy it. Metamask is our favorite, but any ETH wallet will do.

[Click here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask) and follow the instructions to install Metamask.

[!ref Install Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask)

Now you have an Ethereum wallet with Metamask!

## 2. Buy ETH 

To buy HJAELPCOIN, you first need to buy ether (ETH). You can do that easily, right from our website.

Once you have Metamask installed, [go to the HJAELPCOIN presale page](https://www.hjaelpcoin.com/) and **click the button that says "Don't Have ETH?"**

Follow the prompts inside the popup to buy ETH and send it to your wallet.

You can find your wallet address by opening up the Metamask chrome extension and clicking it to copy.

## 3. Buy HJAELPCOIN

Now you can finally buy HJAELPCOIN! 

Go back to [the HJAELPCOIN presale page](https://www.hjaelpcoin.com/), adjust the amount of HJAELPCOIN you want to buy, and **click "Buy Now"**.

Approve the prompts that Metamask gives you. 

Be prepared, "gas fees" charged by Ethereum (basically just transaction fees used to secure the network) may be above $100 if the network is very busy. Typically gas costs between $30-50. 

## 4. Celebrate! :tada:

Congratulations, you're now officially a member of the HJAELP community! :beers:

We can't wait to buidl the most powerful, equitable service marketplace the world has ever seen, alongside you. :heart: 

## 5. Bonus: Add HJAELPCOIN to Metamask

1. Open Metamask and click **Assets**

2. Click **Add Token** at the bottom, then click **Custom Token**

3. Paste in HJAELPCOIN's token address into the top field: 0xb81e074730a5939da7a34a86eb74d457d5320739

4. Click **Add Token**. You now can see HJAELPCOIN in your wallet!
