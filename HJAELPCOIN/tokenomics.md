# HJAELPCOIN Tokenomics

HJAELPCOIN is built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 token standard.

## Token Distribution

There will be a fixed initial supply of 1 billion HJAELPCOIN tokens created at launch. No additional tokens will be minted or mined. None will be burned at launch, but the HJAELP team will retain the ability to manually burn tokens in their possession—even as they do not plan to use this ability. This fixed supply will allow HJAELPCOIN to achieve a reasonable value as it is transacted for services on the HJAELP platform, and lend it the value needed to stand in for fiat currency as medium of exchange.

5% of all HJAELPCOIN tokens (50 million tokens) will be made available in the [initial public pre-sale](./hjaelpcoin-presale.md). 

30% of all tokens will be reserved for potential future pre-sales. In the event that those pre-sales do not occur, then these tokens will instead be held in the Service Economy Wallet and used to reward HJAELPers when they complete work on the HJAELP platform, etc.

39% of all tokens will be reserved in the Service Economy Wallet to be used exclusively for the following purposes:

- Distributing rewards to HJAELPers who complete work on the platform.

- Distributing rewards to clients, Validators, Resolvers, and other community members in return for performing behaviors deemed beneficial to the collective HJAELP ecosystem.

- Distributing grants to exceptional service providers on the basis of merit from time to time. The purpose of these grants will be to encourage adoption of the HJAELP platform by service providers, reward exceptional service providers for their contribution to making HJAELP a great place to hire services, and encourage other service providers to adopt good service provider practices and behaviors.

- Providing liquidity for transactions that occur within the HJAELP platform under specific conditions where liquidity is needed. For example, in the situation where a service requester makes a payment into HJAELP using fiat currency such as USD or EUR, and the service provider elects to receive payment for that service in HJAELPCOIN, or vice versa, the HJAELP platform needs enough liquidity to perform these functions. It is the primary function of the Future Liquidity Wallet to make HJAELPCOIN available to the service provider when a transaction is registered.

2.5% of all tokens will remain in a Future Liquidity Wallet controlled by the HJAELP team to be used exclusively for seeding liquidity on exchanges which may list HJAELPCOIN in the future. For future users of those exchanges, having an initial pool of liquidity is necessary to begin trading HJAELPCOIN. Funds from the Future Liquidity Wallet will be used to fund those initial liquidity pools.

82 million HJAELPCOIN tokens will be set aside for ongoing marketing and development costs. These tokens will be used exclusively to directly advance the HJAELPCOIN roadmap (see below), such as development of Web3 features and automated rewards.

Finally, 18 million HJAELPCOIN tokens will be divided equally between the three HJAELP founders, each thus holding 6 million apiece. These tokens will be put on a vesting schedule as follows: 25% of the tokens will be locked for 6 months, 25% locked for one year, 25% locked for 18 months, and 25% locked for two years. This will serve as an incentive for the founders to continue to grow HJAELPCOIN and HJAELP into the far future.

## Differential Transaction Taxes

HJAELPCOIN token transactions will be subject to different transaction taxes depending on where the transaction takes place. For all transactions that take place within the HJAELP platform, there will be zero transaction tax.

For all transactions that take place outside of the HJAELP platform, such as on a decentralized exchange platform like Uniswap, there will be a transaction tax of 8% applied. This 8% transaction tax will be subject to change by the HJAELPCOIN developers, in case the dynamics of the token need to be shifted to ensure the health of the HJAELP ecosystem in the future. The 8% transaction tax will be split into two equal halves. 

Half the transaction tax (4% of the total transaction) will go to the liquidity pool on the exchange platform being used and itself will be split evenly between ether (ETH) and HJAELPCOIN. This will contribute to a constantly increasing pool of liquidity, which will ensure that the preferred trading pair will always contain tokens against which holders of HJAELPCOIN may sell or buyers may buy.

The remaining half of the transaction tax (4% of the total transaction) will go into the Service Economy Wallet, which will be used to reward users for collective-good behaviors such as leaving reviews and referring new users, as well as for grants to exceptional service providers. We will discuss the Service Economy Wallet in more detail below.

The transaction tax at this level for transactions outside of HJAELP will have one main effect. It will serve as an additional incentive for users to refrain from trading HJAELPCOIN outside the HJAELP platform and use their HJAELPCOIN exclusively for buying services on the HJAELP platform itself. Trading outside the HJAELP platform will increase price volatility, so reducing this trading activity will reduce volatility and ensure HJAELPCOIN remains stable enough to be used as a medium of exchange. 

## Wallet Ownership Limit

There will be a limit on Ethereum wallets containing HJAELPCOIN such that no single wallet can own more than 0.1% of the total token supply. This limit will be subject to change by the HJAELP team in case it gets in the way of larger service transactions. Such a limit is in place in order to stabilize the price of HJAELPCOIN and minimize volatility that may arise with larger buys and sells, especially on decentralized exchange platforms. This will reduce the likelihood of larger holders to amass huge concentrations of HJAELPCOIN. It will also reduce those larger holders’ ability to sell in large quantities within short periods of time, allowing for greater price stability.

## Sell Size Limit

There will be a limit on transactions such that for each sell transaction from a non-contract wallet, no transaction can contain more than 10% of the total token supply. This is to ensure that price volatility stays low in the event of larger holders wanting to sell their HJAELPCOIN. With greater price stability and lower volatility, HJAELPCOIN will retain greater utility as a medium of exchange on the HJAELP platform.

## Network Governance

The HJAELP team will build a portal whereby HJAELPCOIN holders may vote on the use of a portion of Service Economy Wallet funds. Holders will be able to submit proposals for use of funds to advance the goals of the Service Economy Wallet, and all holders will be able to vote on those proposals. Votes will be counted in proportion to the amount of HJAELPCOIN each voter holds. The HJAELP team will set the portion of the Service Economy Wallet which will be eligible to fund community-submitted proposals, as well as the rules for proposal submission and voting. The HJAELP team will also retain final veto power over any proposal submitted and voted on.
