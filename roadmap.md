# HJAELP Roadmap

Here's what we have planned for HJAELP in the coming weeks, months, and years.

Over the last 3 months, we have made rapid progress behind the scenes. This is the story of our journey toward building the best and most equitable service marketplace the world has ever seen.

All throughout, we plan to grow our user base massively by launching in new service verticals and in new cities. Since the nature of rapid growth can be unpredictable, we include mostly technical metrics here in the roadmap. Rest assured, though, we plan to grow HJAELP to be a premier global destination for top service providers of all kinds to sell their skills, earn a living, and control their own destiny.

First we will focus on launching the app and getting our early community bought in via our presale. Once that is complete, we'll continue to add new features to the product even as we grow our user base and brand.
